        <h2>Processes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Processes never execute codes, only <strong>thread</strong>execute the code</li>
            <li>Processes has at least one thread.</li>
            <li>Execution environment created by OS for the program to run in; A structure that contains every thing that a program needs to run</li>
            <li>Every process has its <strong>own</strong> process space, has <strong>own</strong> array of threads
                <ul>
                    <li>each tag in chrome is a process --> has its own address space</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Lots of processes running will slow down the server</li>
            <li>Using <strong>Top</strong> to check the current state of the system</li>
            <li>Using PID (Process Identification) --> every process has its own unique PID</li>
            <li>OS needs to keep track of every process that in the system --> maintain, search, edit, etc</li>
            <li><strong>fork</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a new process that is identical clone of the caller (parent)</li>
                <li style="color:red">Although it has its own address space and own thread array, the program and the address space
                     is an identical clone copy of the parent --> the heap, stack, the global, the code, the program counter, the thread, the registers are the same</li>
                <li>Process considers the relationship --> with fork, we need to maintain the inside process structure and our relationship to children</li>
                <li>The caller fork is parent and new process is child --> needs to maintain this relationship </li>
                <li>Program counter is the same, so after executing, it means when they return from executing they both execute the same instruction 
                    -> both of children and parents return from fork </li>
                <li>The return value for parent and children are different:
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the fork return, parent return the PID of the child</li>
                        <li>Child fork returns 0</li>
                        <li style="color: red">each process has its own PID --> they do not share process space --> but the content
                        of that address space are the same.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>_exit</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>It terminates the calling process</li>
                    <li>Keep track of why the process is terminated -> leave a message (integer --> exit status) --> why the process died</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>waitpid</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let a process wait for another to terminate and retrieve its exist status code</li>
                    <li style="color: red">the current process will be blocked until the waited process terminates --> after wake up --> waitpid retrive the reason(message) the process die</li>
                    <li style="color: red">process only allow to wait on its children --> only care about its children</li>
                    <li>One process death does not affect its child process</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>execv</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>changes the program that a process is running --> does not create a new program</li>
                    <li>keep PID, process structure, <dev style="color: red">child-parent relationship</dev> same</li>
                    <li>address space and thread changes</li>
                    <li>execv takes two params
                        <ul>
                            <li>the second of params is a pointer to array of arguments</li>
                            <li>if execv does work, it does not return</li>
                            <li>take the old address space and create a new address space --> cannot return old address space</li>
                            <li>return if fail --> try to load program --> fail
                                <ul>
                                    <li>wrong program</li>
                                    <li>not enough memory for creating address space</li>
                                    <li>not enough space for creating threads</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>System Calls</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The calls that programmer use to interact with kernel.</li>
        <li><strong>Everything</strong> is done by kernel. (open files, print, all the function calls)</li>
        <li>Make a system call (system functions) use the system calls library (it is <strong style="color: red">NOT</strong> part of 
            kernel) -> ask kernel to do -> return to the user program</li>
        <li>User privileged VS kernel privileged
            <ul>
                <li>User program --> unpriviledged code </li>
                <li>Kernel priviledged --> priviledged code </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Kernel Privilege (high-level privilege)
            <ul>
                <li>Execution privilege controled by CPU</li>
                <li>User program has least privilege --> cannot execute/assess only permitted privileged code --> throw exception</li>
                <li>User program cannot directly call kernel functions or access kernel data structure</li>
                <li>The only way to run kernel code is by interruptions(hardware) and exceptions(software)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>To perform a system call, the application needs to cause an exception to make the system call
            <ul>
                <li>li v0 0 --> v0 put the syscall code</li>
                <li>The kernel checks v0 to determine which system call has been requested --> using kernel ABI (Application Binary Interface)</li>
                <li>ABI all the information to share with user (size of Int, type, syscall code)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Interrupts</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Interrupts are raised by hardward</li>
            <li>CPU receive the interrupts --> find the kernel(by using the stored address of interrupt handler) --> 
                CPU execuate the interrupt handler --> flip to the kernel privilege mode --> interrupt handler save the 
                stage, trap frame --> kernel do things
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptions</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>CPU raise the exceptions --> flip privilege --> call the predetermined location --> exception handler</li>
            <li>exception handler is part of the kernel</li>
            <li>MIPs treat exceptions and interrupts are the same</li>
        </ul>
        <li>System calls take parameters and return values</li>
        <li>The application places parameter value in kernel-specified location before the syscall,
            and looks for return value in that location after the exception handler returns
            <ul>
            <li>How do the application know the kernel-specified location?
                <ul>
                <li>The locations are part of the kernel ABI</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Parameter and return value placement is handled by the application system call library functions.</li>
            <li>On MIPS, parameters go in registers a0,a1,a2,a3
                <ul>
                <li>result success/fail code is in a3 on return</li>
                <li>return value or error code is in v0 on return
                    <ul>
                        <li>lw a0 ... a3</li>
                        <li>syscall --> raise exception</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If a3 return success, then v0 has return value</li>
                <li>If a3 return fail, then v0 has error code(from AVI)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>System Call Software Stack</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Application calls library wrapper function for desired system call</li>
                <li>Library function performs syscall instruction</li>
                <li>Kernel exception handler runs
                    <ul>
                        <li>create trap frame to save program state</li>
                        <li>determine this is a syscall exception</li>
                        <li>determine which system call is being requested</li>
                        <li>call the kernel implementation of it</li>
                        <li>set the return value</li>
                        <li>flip the priviledge back to kernel</li>
                        <li>return from the exception</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>library wrapper function finishes and returns from its call</li>
                <li>application continues execution</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>System call is expensive!!!</li>
        <li>User program is totally isolated from implementation of Kernel</li>
        <li>Example on System call
            <ul>
                <li>printf</li>
                <li>malloc --> depends, if there is no enough memory space, malloc needs to ask OS for more memory</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>User and Kernel Stacks
            <ul>
                <li>Every OS process thread has two stacks, although it only uses one at a time
                    <li>User Stack: while application code is executing 
                        <ul>
                            <li>located in the application's virtual memory (address space)</li>
                            <li>Only go </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Kernel Stack: used while the thread is executing kernel code, after an exception or interrupt
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lives in the kernel</li>
                            <li>Stack holds the trap frames and switch frames (because kernel creates those two frames) </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </li>
                <li>In order to avoid user stack to modify kernel stack, so when flip to kernel mode --> everything(kernel's) flip to the kernel stack</li>
                <li>Kernerl stack can overflow the user stack, so we keep they are separated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Multiprocessing
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple processes existing at the same time</li>
                <li>All process share the availabe hardware resources.</li>
                <li>Thread execute the program instead of process --> we still have context switch, thread yield, thread_switch</li>
                <li>The OS ensures that processes are isolated from one another.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>kernel library --> v0 put the system call code, in a0 - a3 put the parameter to tell which system call --> raise the exception
        --> switch priviledge mode and disable interruption --> execute the common exception handler --> switch the user stack to the kernel stack--
        --> common exception handler save the trap frame on the kernel stack --> common exception called mips trap --> mis trap figure out which exception is it -->
        turn the interruption on --> called that specific exception handler (syscall --> system call dispatcher)  --> inside dispatcher (get v0 a0-a3) --> fork (e.g.) --> call sysfork
        --> return a3(succeed, fail) v0 (succeed code, error code) --> system call return to mips trap --> return common exception --> restore the trap frame to the CPU and flip back user stack -->
        switch to unpriviledge to priviledge mode --> user program running</li>
    </ul>
