        <h2>Key Defination:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>planar embedding</strong> of $G$ is a drawing of $G$ on the plane such that vertices are different points and edges
                    are lines that join vertices s.t. they do not intersect (except at common endpoints)</li>
                <li> A graph that has a planar embedding is a planar graph.</li>
                <li>A <strong>face</strong> of a planar embedding is a connected region on the plane (not separated by lines). Two faces are adjacent
                    if they share at least two edges.</li>
                <li>For a connected planar graph, the boundary walk of a face is a closed walk on the edges around the boundry of the region once around.
                    The degree of the face is the length of its boundry walk.</li>
                <li>Handshaking lemma for Faces:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let $G$ be a planar graph with a planar embedding when $F$ is the set of all faces.
                            Then $$ \sum_{f\in F} deg(f) = 2 |E(G)|$$
                        </li>
                        <li style="color:blue">
                            proof: each edge contributes 2 to the sum of face degrees. One for each side of the edge.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Observation: if $e$ is a bridge, then the two sides of $e$ are in the same face. 
            Otherwise, they are in different faces, since $e$ is in a cycle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Jordan Curve theorem:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Every single closed curve (cycle) on the plane separates the plane into 2 parts, one inside and one outside</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Euler's Formula</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A graph can be different embedding, consider n represents the number of vertices, m represents the number of edges, s represents
                the number of faces: then we have,
                \[
                    \begin{aligned}
                        n - m + s &= 2 \\
                        n - m + s &= 1 + (\text{#}\,\,\text{of} \,\, \text{components})
                    \end{aligned}
                \]
            </li>
            <li>Theorem: For a connected planar graph with an embedding with n vertices, m edges and s faces: $n - m + s = 2$ </li>
            <div style="color:blue">
                <p>Proof by induction: (fix n) inducted on m</p>
                <p>Base case: $m = n - 1$ (spanning tree), thus $s=1$ (no cycles, only one face) \rightarrow the statement holds</p>
                <p>Inductive Hypotheses: Assume Euler's formula holds for any connected planar graph with n vertices, $m-1$ edges</p>
                <p>Inductive Step: Suppose $G$ is connected, planar, n vertices, m edges and s faces</p>
                <div style="margin-left: 101px">
                    <p>Let $e$ be an edge in a cycle of $G$, then $G - e$ is connected an planar.</p>
                    <p>The two sides of $e$ and different faces in $G$, and they merge into one faces in $G-e$ \rightarrow $s-1$ faces</p>
                    <p>By Inductive Hypotheses, the Euler's formula holds for $G-e$</p>
                    <p>So  $n-(m-1) + (s-1) = 2 \Rightarrow n - m + 1 + s -1 = n - m + s = 2$</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Platonic Solids</h2>
        <p>If $G$ can be embedded on a planar, then $G$ can be embedded on a sphere. We then cut across each face to obtain a polyhedron.</p>
        <p><strong>Definition: a connected planar graph is platonic if it has an embedding where every vertex has same degree $(\ge 3)$ and every face has some degree.</strong></p>
        <div style="color:blue">

                \begin{cases}
                n \cdot d_v &= 2m &\text{basic handshaking lemma} \\
                s \cdot d_f &= 2m &\text{handshaking lemma for faces} \\
